# A ChatGPT-powered Chatbot for Mattermost

There's a nice detailed guide about how to do all of the steps below written by @InterestingSoup, [here: Create a ChatGPT bot on Mattermost](https://interestingsoup.com/create-a-chatgpt-bot-on-mattermost/)

Here's the short version - it's easy if you have a Docker container.
You need
 - the [Mattermost token](https://docs.mattermost.com/integrations/cloud-bot-accounts.html) for the bot user `@chatgpt`
 - the [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
 - a Docker container for continuously running the service

First step is to clone this repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yGuy/chatgpt-mattermost-bot.git && cd chatgpt-mattermost-bot
```

For testing, you could now just run `npm install` and `npm run start` or `node src/botservice.js` directly, but be sure to set the below environment variables or pass them to the node process, first!

For production use, in order to create a service on a docker container that will always provide the service without you having to run it on your own PC, you can do the following:

## Docker
Create the docker image
```bash
docker build . -t yguy/chatgpt-mattermost-bot
```

Run Docker service
```bash
docker run -d --restart unless-stopped \
  -e MATTERMOST_URL=https://mattermost.server \
  -e MATTERMOST_TOKEN=abababacdcdcd \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY=234234234234234234 \
  --name chatbot \
  yguy/chatgpt-mattermost-bot
```

With a custom certificate stored in `/absolutepath/to/certfile.crtÂ´ for your mattermost instance (if required for locally hosted mattermost instances on https) you can do it like so
```bash
docker run -d --restart unless-stopped \
  -v /absolutepath/to/certfile.crt:/certs/certfile.crt \
  -e NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=/certs/certfile.crt \
  -e MATTERMOST_URL=https://mattermost.server \
  -e MATTERMOST_TOKEN=abababacdcdcd \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY=234234234234234234 \
  --name chatbot \
  yguy/chatgpt-mattermost-bot
```

Verify it's running
```bash
docker ps
```

Later, to stop the service
```bash
docker stop chatbot
```

## Docker Compose
Edit the environment variables in `docker-compose.yml`.

### Required Environment Variables
```yaml
MATTERMOST_URL: https://mattermost.server
MATTERMOST_TOKEN: abababacdcdcd
OPENAI_API_KEY: sk-234234234234234234
```

### Optional Environment Variables
```yaml
# Set this if using a custom username for the bot, default = @chatgpt
MATTERMOST_BOTNAME: "@chatgpt"

# Console logging output level, default = INFO
DEBUG_LEVEL: TRACE

# Node environment, default = production
NODE_ENV: production
```

### Private TLS Certificate
If your Mattermost instance uses a TLS certificate signed by a private CA, you
will need to provide the CA's public root to the container for validation.

If the root certificate is located at `/absolutepath/to/certfile.crt`, then you
would merge the contents below into the `docker-compose.yml` file:
```yaml
services:
  chatbot:
    volumes:
      - /absolutepath/to/certfile.crt:/certs/certfile.crt:ro
    environment:
      NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS: /certs/certfile.crt
```

### Run the container as a daemon
When all configuration is complete, start the container service.
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Verify it's running:
```bash
docker compose ps
```

To stop the container:
```bash
docker compose down
```


## Example Conversation

Here's an example chat that I just had with our bot:

>@yguy:
>@chatgpt - please write a short introductory paragraph for the README in the GitHub repo that hosts the sources for you, the friendly Mattermost bot. Tell the readers that you enjoy working for the nice people at yWorks and that everybody should install a Mattermost chatbot into their Mattermost chat system to benefit from a nice and helpful assistant like you are. I will include this in the README on the GitHub repo, so make this an engaging text! Thanks!
